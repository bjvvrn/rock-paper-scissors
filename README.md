# Rock Paper Scissors

This project is a GUI-based Rock Paper Scissors game. While building it, I 
practiced using conditional statements such as if...else and switch, and 
strengthened my understanding of declaring and calling functions. I also applied 
good function design principles by ensuring each function performs a single, 
clear task.

The game allows the user to select an option and compares it with a randomly 
generated computer choice to determine the winner.

## Update

The game was originally a console application and has now been upgraded with a 
graphical user interface. While building the GUI, I practiced my CSS skills, 
including flexbox layout, and added basic visual interactivity to the buttons.

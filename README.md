# Rock Paper Scissors

This project consists of creating a Rock Paper Scissors game that runs in the 
console. While building this project, I practiced using conditional statements 
such as `if...else` and `switch`, and strengthened my understanding of declaring 
and calling functions. I also applied good function design principles by 
ensuring each function performs a single, clear task.

The game allows the user to input their choice and then compares it with a 
randomly generated computer choice to determine the winner.

## Features

* Console-based Rock Paper Scissors gameplay.
* Random computer choice generation.
* User input handling.
* Clear function separation and single-responsibility practices.
* Use of fundamental JavaScript concepts:
    * Conditional logic (`if...else`, `switch`).
    * Functions (declaration, invocation return values).
    * Basic program structure and flow control.

## How to play the game
1. Go to the [game page](https://bjvvrn.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/).
